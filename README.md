Chapter II
General rules
• Your project must be realized in a virtual machine.
• Your virtual machine must have all the necessary software to complete your project.
These softwares must be configured and installed.
• You can choose the operating system to use for your virtual machine.
• You must be able to use your virtual machine from a cluster computer.
• You must use a shared folder between your virtual machine and your host machine.
• During your evaluations you will use this folder to share with your repository.
• Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double
free, etc) apart from undefined behaviors. If this happens, your project  will be
considered non functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.
• We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this work
won’t have to be submitted and won’t be graded. It will give you a chance
to easily test your work and your peers’ work. You will find those tests especially
useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use your tests
and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.
• Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git repository will be graded. If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it will be done
after your peer-evaluations. If an error happens in any section of your work during
Deepthought’s grading, the evaluation will stop.
