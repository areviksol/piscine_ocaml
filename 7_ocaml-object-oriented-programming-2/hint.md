 * Every output goes to the standard output, and will be ended by a newline, unless specified otherwise 
 
 * The imposed filenames must be followed to the letter, as well as class names, function names and method names, etc
 
 * Turn-in directories are ex00/, ex01/, . . . , exn/.

 * Unless otherwise explicitly stated, the keywords open, for and while are forbidden. Their use will be flagged as cheating, no questions asked.

 * You are only allowed to use the OCaml syntaxes you learned about since the OCaml module 00 up this current module or project. You are not allowed to use any additional syntax, modules and libraries unless explicitly stated otherwise.

 *  The compiler to use is ocamlopt. When you are required to turn in a function, you must also include anything necessary to compile a full executable. That executable should display some tests that prove that you’ve done the exercise correctly.
 
 * Remember that the special token ";;" is only used to end an expression in the interpreter. Thus, it must never appear in any file you turn in. Regardless, the interpreter is a powerfull ally, learn to use it at its best as soon as possible

 * No coding style is enforced during the OCaml piscine. You can use any style you like, no restrictions. Keep in mind that a code your peer evaluator can’t read is a code he or she can’t grade. As usual, big functions are a weak style.

 * Only the requested files must be turned in and thus present on the repository during the peer-evaluation.
 
 * For every exercise, you are required to turn in a full program with examples to
 prove your classes are working correctly. You may use any function or operator
 you want or see fit to use in your examples — as long as you don’t need to link an
 external library to use it.
 * Each exercise in today’s subject is meant to be a sequel to the previous one; as a
 consequence, you will likely need to use your previous exercises to solve the one
 you’re working on.
 * As an obvious consequence, any exercise with 0 points for any reason (not turned
 in, does not compile, crashes, etc.) means the defense will not continue any further.
 * You are generally free to use any type of data structure you want. However, every
 time a method returns an associative list, it must be sorted in ascending order by
 its index.
 * All chemical formulae for molecules must be written using the Hill notation.
 * All the classes you implement today must be functional. Any imperative class in
 your code means no points for the entire exercise.
 * Your code will not be modified during defenses, which means a non-tested feature
 is a non-functional feature.
 * For each exercise, you are required to write a Makefile, which will compile your
 entire exercise. You can use OCamlMakefile to write your Makefile.
