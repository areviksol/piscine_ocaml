 * Every output goes to the standard output, and will be ended by a newline, unless specified otherwise 
 
 * The imposed filenames must be followed to the letter, as well as class names, function names and method names, etc
 
 * Turn-in directories are ex00/, ex01/, . . . , exn/.

 * Unless otherwise explicitly stated, the keywords open, for and while are forbidden. Their use will be flagged as cheating, no questions asked.

 * You are only allowed to use the OCaml syntaxes you learned about since the OCaml module 00 up this current module or project. You are not allowed to use any additional syntax, modules and libraries unless explicitly stated otherwise.

 *  The compiler to use is ocamlopt. When you are required to turn in a function, you must also include anything necessary to compile a full executable. That executable should display some tests that prove that you’ve done the exercise correctly.
 
 * Remember that the special token ";;" is only used to end an expression in the interpreter. Thus, it must never appear in any file you turn in. Regardless, the interpreter is a powerfull ally, learn to use it at its best as soon as possible

 * No coding style is enforced during the OCaml piscine. You can use any style you like, no restrictions. Keep in mind that a code your peer evaluator can’t read is a code he or she can’t grade. As usual, big functions are a weak style.

 * Only the requested files must be turned in and thus present on the repository during the peer-evaluation.
 
 * Some themes of this day can be hard to understand. Feel free to practice as much as
 you can. They will all be used wisely and frequently during your OCaml developer’s
 life.
 * You are in a functional programming pool, so your coding style MUST be func-
 tional (except for the side effects for input/output). I insist, your code MUST be
 functional; otherwise, you’ll have a tedious defence session.
 * For each exercise of the day, you must provide sufficient material for testing during the defence session. Every functionality that can’t be tested won’t be graded
