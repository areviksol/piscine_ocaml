 * Every output goes to the standard output, and will be ended by a newline, unless specified otherwise 
 
 * The imposed filenames must be followed to the letter, as well as class names, function names and method names, etc
 
 * Turn-in directories are ex00/, ex01/, . . . , exn/.

 * Unless otherwise explicitly stated, the keywords open, for and while are forbidden. Their use will be flagged as cheating, no questions asked.

 * You are only allowed to use the OCaml syntaxes you learned about since the OCaml module 00 up this current module or project. You are not allowed to use any additional syntax, modules and libraries unless explicitly stated otherwise.

 *  The compiler to use is ocamlopt. When you are required to turn in a function, you must also include anything necessary to compile a full executable. That executable should display some tests that prove that you’ve done the exercise correctly.
 
 * Remember that the special token ";;" is only used to end an expression in the interpreter. Thus, it must never appear in any file you turn in. Regardless, the interpreter is a powerfull ally, learn to use it at its best as soon as possible

 * No coding style is enforced during the OCaml piscine. You can use any style you like, no restrictions. Keep in mind that a code your peer evaluator can’t read is a code he or she can’t grade. As usual, big functions are a weak style.

 * Only the requested files must be turned in and thus present on the repository during the peer-evaluation.

 * Unless otherwise specified, you are NOT required to implement your functions with
 tail recursion

 * However, if your function must be implemented with tail recursion, it indicates
 performance requirements. Therefore, functions that run slower than O(n) (linear
 time) will receive no points

 * Some exercises involve intensive calculations, which means it’s acceptable if some
 of your functions are slow.

 * For the same reason, you will not lose points if your code causes a stack overflow.

 * However, any infinite recursion will result in zero points for the exercise.
 
 * Any use of while and/or for loops is considered cheating, without exception
 
 * Unless otherwise specified, the exercises you submit must fit within ONE (1) top-
 level let definition. Use nested definitions and be resourceful.

 * Today’s exercises require you to write one (or several) functions, but you must
    submit a complete working program for each exercise. This means each file must
    include one let definition for the exercise you are solving and a let () definition
    to create a complete program with sufficient examples demonstrating that you have
    solved the exercise correctly. The examples provided in the subject are usually
    insufficient. If there’s no example proving a feature works, the feature is considered
    non-functional 
 
 * Unless otherwise specified, you cannot use any function from the standard library
    to solve your exercise. However, you are free to use any function you wish within
    the let () definition for your examples, as long as you do not need to link your
    exercise with an external library 
    
 * As stated in the general rules, you cannot use OCaml structures you haven’t yet
    seen in the videos. Just to clarify, any use of the keywords match and with is
    forbidden and will be considered cheating, without exception.
    • Although they are also functions, all operators are allowed. Operators are sur-
    rounded by parentheses in the Pervasives module’s documentation.
