 * Every output goes to the standard output, and will be ended by a newline, unless specified otherwise 
 
 * The imposed filenames must be followed to the letter, as well as class names, function names and method names, etc
 
 * Turn-in directories are ex00/, ex01/, . . . , exn/.

 * Unless otherwise explicitly stated, the keywords open, for and while are forbidden. Their use will be flagged as cheating, no questions asked.

 * You are only allowed to use the OCaml syntaxes you learned about since the OCaml module 00 up this current module or project. You are not allowed to use any additional syntax, modules and libraries unless explicitly stated otherwise.

 *  The compiler to use is ocamlopt. When you are required to turn in a function, you must also include anything necessary to compile a full executable. That executable should display some tests that prove that you’ve done the exercise correctly.
 
 * Remember that the special token ";;" is only used to end an expression in the interpreter. Thus, it must never appear in any file you turn in. Regardless, the interpreter is a powerfull ally, learn to use it at its best as soon as possible

 * No coding style is enforced during the OCaml piscine. You can use any style you like, no restrictions. Keep in mind that a code your peer evaluator can’t read is a code he or she can’t grade. As usual, big functions are a weak style.

 * Only the requested files must be turned in and thus present on the repository during the peer-evaluation.
 
 * For exercises 00, 01, 02, 03, and 04, the rec keyword is forbidden and considered cheating. No questions asked. Yes, I know, but still.
 
 * For every exercise of today’s subject, you are allowed to use every function in the Pervasives module. Each exercise’s header specifies what you are allowed to use aside from these functions. 

 * For today and only for today, the keywords for and while are allowed.

 * Any warning at compilation or uncaught exception means your exercise is non functional, and you will therefore earn no points for it
 
 * Some exercises require you to write a full program, while others just specify a function. If you are just asked to write a function, you still need to turn in a full program, including a let () definition with examples to show that your function is working properly. You can use any functions you deem fit to use in your let () definition, as long as you don’t have to link an external library
 * if you are required to provide your own examples, remember that your tests must be comprehensive. A non-tested feature is a non-functional feature.
